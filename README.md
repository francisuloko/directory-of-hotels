# Microverse HTML & CSS Captstone Project
## Directry of local businesses
### [Solo Project]

> Responsive Web Design Project built with HTML & CSS, Bootstrap, Git and Github

[![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)]()

This project involves building a responsive, mobile first, local directory called TwoSteps. A local directory enables a user to find local business in their area. The web app displays the details of a registered business in two simple steps by 1.) entering a search criteria and 2.) selecting a business from the list of search results. The name of the app is derived from the number of actions (two steps) required to land on a business page.

TwoSteps is a project based on [PatashuleKE](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) designed by Matthew Njuguna and Sam Achola. "Patashule is a web app that bridges the gap between schools and parents" (Behance). In a similar way, twosteps bridges the gap between locals and local businesses.
