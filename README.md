This project involves building a responsive, mobile first, Hotel directory called TwoSteps. This history directory enables a user to find hotels around the world. The web app displays the details of a registered hotel in two simple steps by 1.) entering a search criteria and 2.) selecting a hotel from the list of search results. The name of the app is derived from the number of actions (two steps) required to land on a hotel's page.

TwoSteps is a project based on [PatashuleKE](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) designed by Matthew Njuguna and Sam Achola. "Patashule is a web app that bridges the gap between schools and parents" (Behance). In a similar way, twosteps bridges the gap between people on transit and hotels around the world.
